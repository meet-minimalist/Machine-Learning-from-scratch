# Machine-Learning-from-scratch
Repo contains all machine learning algorithms implemented in pure python and numpy without Scikit Learn. The sole purpose of this repo is to explore the core algorithm without any kind of library. Once we know the inner details of these algorithms, we can use highly optimized Scikit Learn implementations.

### Todo - Following algorithms to be covered in this repo. This will be kept updated with new algorithms as well.
